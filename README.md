# Multi-Agent Architectures and Human-in-the-Loop Systems

This repository contains a collection of advanced agent-based systems developed using Python and cutting-edge frameworks. The goal is to simulate intelligent behaviors across hierarchical, supervised, and swarm-based multi-agent environments.

## Contents
- `Agent_Executor.ipynb`: Core executor pattern for agents
- `Hierarchical_Multi-agent.ipynb`: Hierarchical communication among agents
- `Human_in_loop.ipynb`: Integration of human decision-making in AI loops
- `multi-agent_network.ipynb`: Decentralized agent networking
- `multi-agent_supervisor.ipynb`: Supervisor control over agent tasks
- `supervisor_and_swarm.ipynb`: Combining centralized and swarm intelligence

## Tools & Frameworks
- Python 3.x
- LangChain / LangGraph
- Agentic Planning
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Future Work
- Deploy agents with LangGraph
- Visualization of agent communication
- Real-world application simulation
